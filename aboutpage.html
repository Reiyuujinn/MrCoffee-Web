            <h4>The Spark – 2015</h4>
            <p>In a crowded city filled with routines, Susanto Liman found peace in a humble cup of coffee. Inspired by his love for meaningful conversations and creativity, he dreamed of creating a space where coffee could bring people together. MR.COFFEE started as an idea scribbled in a notebook during quiet late nights.</p>

            <h4>The First Cup – 2017</h4>
            <p>After two years of planning and learning, the first MR.COFFEE shop opened its doors. With mismatched furniture, walls filled with customer doodles, and beans sourced from local farmers, the café quickly became a hidden gem for students, artists, and dreamers.</p>

            <h4>Community Grows – 2020</h4>
            <p>Despite challenges during the global pandemic, MR.COFFEE adapted by launching takeout and delivery services. More importantly, the café became a symbol of warmth and connection — even from a distance. Customers supported one another, and the brand grew stronger, united by shared cups and stories.</p>
